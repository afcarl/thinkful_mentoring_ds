Mentoring @ Thinkful Repository
=========================

I developed this repo to help my students who are working through Thinkfuls' Intro to Data Science course.


I recommend that students first head over to the ipython_notebook folder, and get set up with this excellent tool. After that, there are some examples and "getting started" code for a variety of lessons.


 Please message me if you have any suggestions.
